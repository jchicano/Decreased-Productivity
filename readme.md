# Decreased Productivity

> **Note:** This is a maintained fork of the original [Decreased Productivity extension](https://github.com/jchicano/Decreased-Productivity), updated to Manifest V3 for compatibility with modern Chrome versions (88+).

Discreetly surf the web! Control exactly how you want web pages to look like. A Chrome and Firefox extension.

**Current Version:** 0.47.0.1
**Chrome Compatibility:** Chrome 88+ (tested on Chrome 141+)

* ~~Chrome Web Store~~ (original extension was unpublished - see installation instructions below)
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/decreased-productivity-andryou/

Decreased Productivity (DP) creates a more "consistent" browsing experience (for you and others around you) by letting you control what you want to see ("stealth browsing" => text/page background colours, the cloaking of images, hiding page favicons, changing fonts, etc.). You can choose what style you want (e.g. green text on a black background) by going to the Options page (right-click on icon in address bar and click on "Options"). DP has tab-specific support and domain whitelisting/blacklisting!

Translated for 17 different languages/dialects: Arabic, German, English (US), English (British), Spanish, Tagalog, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Chinese (Simplified), and Chinese (Traditional)!
